/*
 * fdk_window.h — Faded Dream ToolKit window API
 *
 * A top-level window backed by whichever platform backend the owning
 * fdk_context selected (X11 or Wayland — see fdk_core.h). No backend
 * type ever appears here; see docs/architecture.md, "no backend
 * leakage".
 *
 * Threading: window functions are UI-thread-only, like the rest of
 * FDK — see docs/threading.md.
 *
 * Phase 2 scope: creation, destruction, show/hide, title, size
 * (including min/max hints), close-request handling, and configure
 * (resize) notification. Custom window decorations (FDK-drawn title
 * bars) are NOT implemented yet — see docs/roadmap.md, Phase 7. What
 * you get today are whatever decorations the platform/compositor
 * draws (X11 window manager decorations, or Wayland xdg-decoration
 * server-side decorations where the compositor supports them).

 * button on the right — and asks the backend to drop the window
 * manager's own chrome (X11: _MOTIF_WM_HINTS). Dragging the band
 * moves the window where the backend allows it (X11). The close
 * button delivers a normal FDK_EVENT_WINDOW_CLOSE_REQUEST, so the
 * application's close semantics are identical to the WM's.
 *
 * The title bar is a widget subtree under the window's root: it is
 * themed like every catalog widget (fdk_theme_set_default repaints
 * it), fdk_window_set_title keeps its text in sync, and the content
 * widget (fdk_window_set_content) is laid out BELOW the band.
 *
 * Returns FDK_ERR_UNSUPPORTED when the backend cannot drop its own
 * decorations (Wayland until xdg-decoration lands) — in that case
 * nothing changes: drawing FDK's bar over the compositor's would
 * give every window two title bars.
