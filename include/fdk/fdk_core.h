/*
 * fdk_core.h — Faded Dream ToolKit core lifecycle
 *
 * Every FDK application follows this shape:
 *
 *     fdk_context *ctx = NULL;
 *     fdk_result r = fdk_init(&ctx, NULL);
 *     if (!fdk_ok(r)) { ... }
 *
 *     // create windows, widgets, run the event loop...
 *     fdk_run(ctx);
 *
 *     fdk_shutdown(ctx);
 *
 * Threading: the fdk_context and everything reachable from it (windows,
 * widgets, timers) must only be touched from the thread that called
 * fdk_init() — conventionally the "main" or "UI" thread. See
 * docs/threading.md for how to schedule work from other threads onto
 * the UI thread.
