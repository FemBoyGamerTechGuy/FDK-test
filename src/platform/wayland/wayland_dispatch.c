/* Flush libwayland's output buffer after listener callbacks have run.
 *
 * Requests marshalled by a listener (or by any window-op call made
 * outside the poll loop) sit in the connection's output buffer until
 * something flushes them — libwayland does NOT auto-flush. Without
 * this trailing flush, context.c's loop goes back to blocking in
 * poll() with requests still queued: the compositor is waiting for
 * our data, we're waiting for its events, and the window appears
 * only when an unrelated event (a ping, a capture) happens to wake
 * the loop. Flushing here guarantees everything queued during this
 * dispatch reaches the compositor before we block again.
 *
 * EAGAIN (socket send buffer full) is not an error here: the request
 * is still queued and will go out on the next flush; large transfers
 * just need the compositor to drain first. */

/* Unlike X11 (x11_dispatch.c), Wayland's client library already does
 * event translation FOR us at the wl_*_listener callback level — each
 * listener function above (wayland_seat.c, wayland_window.c) calls
 * conn->dispatch() directly as events arrive, rather than this
 * function pulling raw events off a queue and translating them one by
 * one. dispatch_pending() here is purely "ask libwayland-client to
 * read and process whatever's queued", which ends up invoking those
 * listeners synchronously.
 *
 * This follows the standard libwayland idiom for an external event
 * loop (context.c's poll() loop is exactly that): prepare_read() /
 * poll on the fd / read_events() / dispatch_pending(), rather than
 * the simpler wl_display_dispatch() (which does its own internal
 * blocking read and would be wrong to call after our own poll() —
 * that risks a second, redundant blocking read). See
 * https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/apb.html for the pattern
 * this mirrors. */
